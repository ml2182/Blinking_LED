Blinking LED

This is my first project, where I used FPGA design to build a simple LED blinker at a frequency of 1Hz. In this project, I have developed my skills in SystemVerilog, Vivado Simulations and Git.
It includes both the design (`Blinking_LED.sv`) and a testbench (`tb_Blinking_LED.sv`) for simulation.
